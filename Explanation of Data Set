   For my data set, I chose a list of all of the worlds soccer players,
   their age, their country, and their skill rating. I'm part of a big
   soccer family and we all enjoy playing and watching each other play
   soccer. It is a fitting data set for me, and I chose it right away when
   I saw it on kaggle. It was fun looking at all of the best American players,
   and it makes me optimistic that they're so young!
